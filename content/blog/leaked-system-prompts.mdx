## Introduction

System prompts are the secret instructions that guide AI assistants in their responses, tone, safety, and capabilities. By analyzing leaked prompts, we can better understand how leading AI companies design their models to be helpful, safe, and aligned with user needs.

## Key Takeaways

- System prompts define the core behavior, safety, and personality of AI assistants.
- Each company has a unique philosophy and approach to prompt design.
- Comparing prompts reveals trends in safety, transparency, and user interaction.
- Understanding prompts helps researchers and developers build better, safer AI systems.

## What Are System Prompts?

System prompts are the initial instructions given to an AI model before any user input. They set the boundaries, capabilities, and style of the assistant. For example, a prompt might instruct the AI to be polite, avoid certain topics, or cite sources.

## How System Prompts Shape AI Behavior

System prompts:
- Define the assistant's identity and knowledge boundaries
- Set rules for safety, privacy, and ethical behavior
- Specify formatting, tone, and language use
- Control access to tools and external APIs
- Guide how the AI handles uncertainty, refusals, and sensitive topics

## Prompt Categories by Company
