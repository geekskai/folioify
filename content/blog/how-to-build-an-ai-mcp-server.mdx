### Setting up the project directory and environment

Start by organizing your workspace. Make a folder for your project. This folder will hold all files and settings. It keeps things neat and easy to find. Use tools like Visual Studio Code or PyCharm to write your code. These tools help with debugging and highlighting code.

Next, set up Git for version control. Git lets you track changes and work with others. Run this command to start a Git repository:

```bash
git init
```

Prepare your environment for AI tools. If using Python, make a virtual environment. This keeps your project’s dependencies separate. Use this command:

```bash
python -m venv venv

```
Activate the virtual environment, and you’re ready to continue.

### Installing dependencies and configuring the server

After setting up, install the needed tools. For Python servers, use FastMCP SDK. It makes building and managing servers easier. Install it with:

```bash
uv add "mcp[cli]"
```

If you’re using an existing project, follow these steps:




1. Clone the project: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/calvinmagezi/mts-mcp.git
cd mts-mcp
```



2. Install tools: 

```bash
bun install

```



3. Build the server: 

```bash
bun run build
```

Find the settings file to configure the server. On MacOS, it’s usually here:
`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`.
On Windows, check: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`.

### Writing the server code

Now, write the server code. Start by creating server classes and logic. Use Python’s `asyncio` library to handle many requests at once. Here’s a simple example:

```python
import asyncio

class MCPServer:
    async def handle_request(self, request):
        # Add code to process requests
        pass

    async def start_server(self):
        server = await asyncio.start_server(self.handle_request, '127.0.0.1', 8080)
        async with server:
            await server.serve_forever()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    server = MCPServer()
    asyncio.run(server.start_server())

```

To make the server faster, add caching for common data. Use asynchronous I/O for network tasks. Break large data into smaller pieces for easier handling. These steps help your server manage heavy traffic smoothly.

Follow these instructions to build a strong and scalable AI MCP server.

### Adding error handling and logging.

Error handling and logging are key for a dependable AI MCP server. They help find and fix problems fast, keeping the server running well. Without them, spotting issues is hard, and important events might be missed.

Start by adding error handling to your server code. Use Python’s try and except to catch errors. For example:

```bash
try:
    # Code that might cause an error
    result = process_request(request)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error happened: {e}")

```

This stops the server from crashing when unexpected problems occur. You can also save error details for later. Use Python’s logging module to write errors to a file. Example:

```bash
import logging

logging.basicConfig(filename='server.log', level=logging.ERROR)
logging.error(f"An error happened: {e}")
```

Good logging shows how your server behaves. It helps track actions and spot strange activity. Tools like Raygun’s Error Diagnosis Agent show how logging improves workflows. For instance, Raygun’s MCP setup cut error fixing time by 40%, proving its value.

To make your server stronger, add alerts for big errors. Alerts warn you quickly so you can fix problems fast. By using error handling and logging, your AI MCP server will work better and stay secure.

### Testing the server locally with tools like MCP Inspector.

Testing locally checks if your server works before going live. MCP Inspector makes this easy by showing server actions clearly. It lets you test requests, watch responses, and find problems.

First, run your server locally. Open a terminal and start it with Python:


```bash
python server.py
```

When the server is running, open MCP Inspector. Connect it by entering the server’s IP and port, like 127.0.0.1:8080 for local servers.

Use MCP Inspector to send test requests. Watch how the server handles them and replies. If errors show up, check your logs to find the issue. This helps improve your server’s features.

Testing also checks how the server handles heavy use. Simulate many requests to see if it slows down. If it does, improve your code with caching or better async tasks.

By testing well, you make sure your server is ready for real use. MCP Inspector’s clear details make testing simple, helping you build a reliable AI MCP server.
