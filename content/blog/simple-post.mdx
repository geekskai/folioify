# Building a Simple Blog with Next.js

Creating a blog with Next.js is straightforward and enjoyable. In this post, we'll go through the basics.

## Why Next.js for Blogging?

Next.js provides several features that make it perfect for blogging:

1. **Static Site Generation**: Blogs benefit from static generation for better performance
2. **Markdown Support**: With MDX, you can write content in Markdown with React components
3. **Image Optimization**: Next.js optimizes images for better performance
4. **Easy Deployment**: Deploy easily on Vercel, Netlify, or other platforms

## Basic Setup

To start, create a new Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-blog
cd my-blog
```

## Adding ContentLayer

ContentLayer helps manage your Markdown or MDX content:

```bash
npm install contentlayer next-contentlayer
```

## Conclusion

That's the foundation of a simple Next.js blog! You can extend it with more features as needed.
