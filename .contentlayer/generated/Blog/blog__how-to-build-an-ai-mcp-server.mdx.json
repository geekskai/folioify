Debugging tools, like the open-source Inspector, help test and fix issues during development.\n\n### Knowledge prerequisites\n\nBefore starting, learn programming basics. Python is a good choice, but knowing other languages helps too. Understand networking to see how servers and clients connect.\n\nLearn basic AI ideas, like how machine learning models handle data and give answers. This will help you add AI tools to your MCP server.\n\nIf you're new to these topics, try online courses or tutorials to improve your skills.\n\n### Setting up the development environment\n\nSetting up your workspace is very important. Follow these steps to begin:\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Pick an IDE or text editor, like Visual Studio Code or PyCharm.\n2. Make a project folder to keep files and AI tasks organized.\n3. Use Git for version control to track changes and work with others.\n4. Add APIs like Google Drive or Slack to expand your tools.\n5. Test your server with debugging tools like Inspector to improve it.\n\nOrganizing your workspace well makes building an AI MCP server easier and faster.\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide to Build an AI MCP Server\n\n![Step-by-Step Guide to Build an AI MCP Server](/images/blog/build-an-ai-mcp-server.png)\n\n\n### Setting up the project directory and environment\n\nStart by organizing your workspace. Make a folder for your project. This folder will hold all files and settings. It keeps things neat and easy to find. Use tools like Visual Studio Code or PyCharm to write your code. These tools help with debugging and highlighting code.\n\nNext, set up Git for version control. Git lets you track changes and work with others. Run this command to start a Git repository:\n\n```bash\ngit init\n```\n\nPrepare your environment for AI tools. If using Python, make a virtual environment. This keeps your project’s dependencies separate. Use this command:\n\n```bash\npython -m venv venv\n\n```\nActivate the virtual environment, and you’re ready to continue.\n\n### Installing dependencies and configuring the server\n\nAfter setting up, install the needed tools. For Python servers, use FastMCP SDK. It makes building and managing servers easier. Install it with:\n\n```bash\nuv add \"mcp[cli]\"\n```\n\nIf you’re using an existing project, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n\n1. Clone the project: \n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/calvinmagezi/mts-mcp.git\ncd mts-mcp\n```\n\n\n\n2. Install tools: \n\n```bash\nbun install\n\n```\n\n\n\n3. Build the server: \n\n```bash\nbun run build\n```\n\nFind the settings file to configure the server. On MacOS, it’s usually here:\n`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`.\nOn Windows, check: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`.\n\n### Writing the server code\n\nNow, write the server code. Start by creating server classes and logic. Use Python’s `asyncio` library to handle many requests at once. Here’s a simple example:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nclass MCPServer:\n    async def handle_request(self, request):\n        # Add code to process requests\n        pass\n\n    async def start_server(self):\n        server = await asyncio.start_server(self.handle_request, '127.0.0.1', 8080)\n        async with server:\n            await server.serve_forever()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    server = MCPServer()\n    asyncio.run(server.start_server())\n\n```\n\nTo make the server faster, add caching for common data. Use asynchronous I/O for network tasks. Break large data into smaller pieces for easier handling. These steps help your server manage heavy traffic smoothly.\n\nFollow these instructions to build a strong and scalable AI MCP server.\n\n### Adding error handling and logging.\n\nError handling and logging are key for a dependable AI MCP server. They help find and fix problems fast, keeping the server running well. Without them, spotting issues is hard, and important events might be missed.\n\nStart by adding error handling to your server code. Use Python’s try and except to catch errors. For example:\n\n```bash\ntry:\n    # Code that might cause an error\n    result = process_request(request)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"An error happened: {e}\")\n\n```\n\nThis stops the server from crashing when unexpected problems occur. You can also save error details for later. Use Python’s logging module to write errors to a file. Example:\n\n```bash\nimport logging\n\nlogging.basicConfig(filename='server.log', level=logging.ERROR)\nlogging.error(f\"An error happened: {e}\")\n```\n\nGood logging shows how your server behaves. It helps track actions and spot strange activity. Tools like Raygun’s Error Diagnosis Agent show how logging improves workflows. For instance, Raygun’s MCP setup cut error fixing time by 40%, proving its value.\n\nTo make your server stronger, add alerts for big errors. Alerts warn you quickly so you can fix problems fast. By using error handling and logging, your AI MCP server will work better and stay secure.\n\n### Testing the server locally with tools like MCP Inspector.\n\nTesting locally checks if your server works before going live. MCP Inspector makes this easy by showing server actions clearly. It lets you test requests, watch responses, and find problems.\n\nFirst, run your server locally. Open a terminal and start it with Python:\n\n\n```bash\npython server.py\n```\n\nWhen the server is running, open MCP Inspector. Connect it by entering the server’s IP and port, like 127.0.0.1:8080 for local servers.\n\nUse MCP Inspector to send test requests. Watch how the server handles them and replies. If errors show up, check your logs to find the issue. This helps improve your server’s features.\n\nTesting also checks how the server handles heavy use. Simulate many requests to see if it slows down. If it does, improve your code with caching or better async tasks.\n\nBy testing well, you make sure your server is ready for real use. MCP Inspector’s clear details make testing simple, helping you build a reliable AI MCP server.\n\n## Integration with AI Tools\n\n\n![Integration with AI Tools](/images/blog/integration-with-ai-tools.png)\n\n\n\n\n### Deploying the MCP server to a cloud platform\n\nPutting your MCP server on a cloud platform makes it scalable, secure, and easy to access worldwide. Platforms like Cloudflare are great for this. Their serverless system, Cloudflare Workers, runs code near users, cutting down delays. This is very helpful for apps needing quick responses. Cloudflare also offers strong security, like a Web Application Firewall and DDoS protection, making it safe for sensitive AI tasks.\n\nYou can also use methods like Kubernetes microservices or serverless functions. These improve scalability and lower management work. The table below shows some common deployment methods and their benefits:\n\n\n| Deployment Strategy                    | Benefits                                             |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Kubernetes-based microservices    | Boosts scalability and handles errors better.        |\n| Serverless functions                   | Cuts down on management tasks.                       |\n| API gateway integration                | Helps with routing and managing context.             |\n\n\nUsing the cloud for your MCP server builds an AI system that is secure and efficient.\n\n### Connecting the server with AI platforms like Claude or VSCode\n\nLinking your MCP server to AI platforms like Claude or VSCode makes tasks easier and faster. For example, Claude 3.7 learns from system feedback better than Claude 3.5. This helps it adjust and handle tasks like organizing files more effectively.\n\nVSCode also benefits from MCP connections.
