# Content Management with ContentLayer

This project uses ContentLayer to manage blog content written in MDX.

## Content Structure

- [content/blog](mdc:content/blog) - Contains all blog posts in MDX format
- [contentlayer.config.ts](mdc:contentlayer.config.ts) - Defines the schema for blog content

## Blog Post Schema

As defined in [contentlayer.config.ts](mdc:contentlayer.config.ts), each blog post requires:

- `title` - The title of the blog post (string, required)
- `date` - Publication date (date, required)
- `description` - A short description (string, required)
- `cover` - Cover image path (string, optional)
- `tags` - List of tags (string[], default: [])
- `published` - Whether the post is published (boolean, default: true)

## ContentLayer Usage

1. Blog posts must be placed in the `content/blog` directory with `.md` or `.mdx` extension
2. Front matter must contain the required fields
3. ContentLayer generates types and data that can be imported in components
4. The route for blog posts is automatically generated as `/blog/[slug]`
5. Reading time is computed automatically
